# OctoAcme — Risk Management & Communication

## Purpose
Explain how to identify, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies.

## Risk Register
The **Project Manager** owns and maintains the risk register. The register is a simple table with:
- ID
- Description
- Impact (High/Med/Low)
- Likelihood (High/Med/Low)
- Owner (person responsible for mitigation)
- Mitigation plan
- Status

The risk register should be reviewed at weekly syncs and updated as risks evolve or new risks are identified.

## Risk Lifecycle
- Identify: during planning and ongoing execution
- Assess: estimate impact and likelihood
- Mitigate: reduced via actions, contingency plans
- Monitor: review at weekly syncs and update status

## Stakeholder Communication
The **Project Manager** coordinates stakeholder communication, with support from the **Change Manager** for change-related communications. 

Activities include:
- Identify stakeholder groups and communication needs (e.g., engineering, sales, support)
- Provide regular updates (weekly or milestone-based)
- Use a single source of truth (project README or release doc) for status
- Work with **User Advocate** to ensure user-facing communications address user concerns
- Coordinate with **Stakeholder Committee** for executive-level updates

## Communication Templates

## Escalation Paths
- **Level 1** (Team-level) → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor
- **Level 2** (Cross-team/Resource) → PM escalates to Stakeholder Committee
- **Level 3** (Strategic/Budget) → Sponsor presents to Stakeholder Committee for decision
- **Security incidents**: Follow the security incident runbook and notify Security on-call immediately, then inform PM and Stakeholder Committee as appropriate
