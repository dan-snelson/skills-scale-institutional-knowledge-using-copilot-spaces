## Conflict Resolution

### When responsibilities overlap or conflict:
1. Refer to this document for primary ownership
2. Schedule clarification discussion with PM facilitating
3. Update this document if needed to reflect agreed changes
4. Communicate changes to all affected team members

### Escalation for role clarity:
- **First level**: Discuss within team, PM facilitates
- **Second level**: Product Manager and PM jointly decide
- **Third level**: Stakeholder Committee provides direction
